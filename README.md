customizable modular shelf

Outputs a module for a shelfing system inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:681835.

A lot of customisability in about 100 lines of code :)

//connectors_angle..very experimental feature

//thickness of your boards

//how long should the cutout for the board be?

//depth of the cutout

//thickness of the walls

//very special, but if you want a 1-connector-piece with foot to face up or to the side..no problemo

//how thick should the foot be?

//what width should the foot have?

//should there be a hole for the board to be fixed with a screw? 

//diameter of the hole
